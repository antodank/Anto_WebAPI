IIS (Internet Information Services) is one of the most powerful web servers from Microsoft that is used to host your ASP.NET Web application.

Whenever a request comes from Client to Server, it will hit HTTP.SYS First

HTTP.SYS is Responsible for pass the request to the particular Application pool

Application Pool then forwards the request to worker process (w3wp.exe) associated with it

Worker process (w3wp.exe) reads the URL of the request and loads the correct ISAPI extension. 

ISAPI extensions are the IIS way to handle requests for different resources.

ISAPI Extension then creates an HTTPRuntime Object to Process the request via HTTPModule and HTTPhandler

HttpRutime calls the ProcessRequest method in the page requested which starts processing of the request.


Depending on the extension ASP.NET routes the request to an appropriate handler that is responsible for picking up requests.
