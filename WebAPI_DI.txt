Add Singleton
When we register a type as singleton, only one instance is available throughout the application and for every request.
It is similar to having a static object.
The instance is created for the first request and the same is available throughout the application and for each subsequent requests.

Disposed when App shutdown

Add Scoped
Add scoped specifies that a single object is available per request.


Add Transient
When we register a type as Transient, every time a new instance is created.

Disposed - End of evry request
